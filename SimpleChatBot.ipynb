    "### Chatbot Documentation: Simple Financial Query Responder\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a rudimentary chatbot designed to answer specific financial questions based on pre-analyzed data for Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla from 2022 to 2024. When a user enters a query, the `get_response` function compares the lowercase version of the input to a set of predefined questions. If an exact match is found, the function retrieves the corresponding information directly from the pandas DataFrame (`df`) that holds the financial data and returns a formatted response. If no exact match is found, the chatbot provides a default \"Sorry...\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predefined Queries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot is currently programmed to respond to the following financial queries (case-insensitive):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What was the total revenue for Apple in 2023?\n",
    "2.  How much did Tesla's net income grow from 2022 to 2023?\n",
    "3.  What were the total assets for Microsoft in 2024?\n",
    "4.  What was the average revenue growth across all companies in 2023?\n",
    "5.  Give me a summary of Apple's financial performance in 2024?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Limited Scope:** The chatbot can only understand and respond to the five specific predefined queries listed above. It cannot handle variations in phrasing, synonyms, related questions, or queries about other financial metrics or companies.\n",
    "* **Exact Matching (after lowercasing):** The chatbot relies on an exact match (after converting to lowercase) between the user's input and the predefined queries. Even slight differences in wording will result in an inability to provide an answer.\n",
    "* **Canned Responses:** The responses are pre-programmed and directly extracted from the loaded and analyzed data. The chatbot does not perform any real-time calculations or analysis based on the user's input beyond this lookup.\n",
    "* **No Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The chatbot lacks any natural language understanding capabilities. It cannot interpret the meaning or intent behind more complex or conversational queries.\n",
    "* **Data Dependency:** The chatbot's knowledge is limited to the data present in the `financial_data.csv` file and the calculations performed in the initial data loading and analysis steps. It cannot access or process any new or external information.\n",
    "* **Basic Interaction:** The current implementation provides a simple command-line interface within the Jupyter Notebook. It lacks a more user-friendly or interactive interface."
